This project provides historical trade data for complex options strategy "box spread" on the EURO STOXX 50 (OESX) and Swiss Market Index (OSMI). Brokers typically don't offer past execution data for such multi-leg orders, leaving investors without a clear view of where the market has been and forcing them to estimate fair pricing.

The data visualized on the graph is extracted from EUREX T7 Entry Service .csv files, which provide past trade data for off-order-book activity. While this isn't the same as official exchange reported trade data - which is expensive and often out of reach for individual investors, it offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative for gauging where the market is at.
